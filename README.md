# FlexiCards for Android
An Android app for easy learning vocabulary, definitons and facts on the go.

Minimal supported Android version is 4.2 (API 17).

## Installation

Download the latest .apk file [here](https://github.com/ksmirenko/flexicards-android/releases). Open it on your Android device to launch installation.
**Warning**: installation from untrusted sources must be enabled in your device's security settings.

## What it is and how it works
You have a lot of paired information: terms and definitions, foreign words and translations, etc. You want to learn it all.

So you get **cards** in which something is written on the _front side_ and something on the _back side_.

Content is organized into **categories** by area of study (English, Russian, biology, rocket science, Elvish, High Valyrian, whatever). There is a _dictionary_ for each category.

There are **modules** within categories. Modules are just card packs.

_And you can view, learn, edit, create, import and share all that stuff._

## Current features:
1. Viewing and flipping cards. There is some demonstrational content included.
2. Viewing dictionary of each category.
3. Saving user progress on each module is saved between application launches. You can view either all or previously unanswered cards of a module.

## Features to be implemented:
1. Importing content from a file.
2. Editing, adding and deleting categories, cards, modules.
3. Importing content from [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/).
4. A custom content store.

## What else?
FlexiCards project is bigger than a single Android app. I also want there to be:
- moar useful content;
- a cool website;
- an iOS app;
- a WP app (I know there are few WP owners, but they exist nonetheless, and I'm one).

## Q&A
> Why another flashcard app? There are plenty already.

I have wanted to develop this project since 2012. I made a simpler and uglier version of it for myself (originally called WordWorm) when I was preparing for TOEFL and SATs, and decided to create a holistic, elaborate flashcard app. Now, finally, I got to it and I want it to be awesome.

> How is it different from <...>?

It has categories, it has minimalistic design, and it is made with love.

> Can I contribute code, content or advice?

Sure! Just [create an issue](https://github.com/ksmirenko/flexicards-android/issues/new) or [contact me directly](mailto:ksmirenko@gmail.com).
